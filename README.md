# Waste Classification System

The Waste Classification System is a computer vision application developed to classify different types of waste in images using object detection models based on YOLOv5 and YOLOv7 architectures. The system can successfully classify 6 different classes of waste in an image inlcuding plastic, metal, biodegradable, glass, cardboard and paper.

## Object Detection Models

- **YOLOv5**: YOLOv5 is a popular object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. It employs a single-stage architecture that directly predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities from images.
- **YOLOv7**: YOLOv7 is an advanced version of the YOLO model series. It incorporates improvements in model architecture and training strategies to achieve better performance in object detection tasks.
